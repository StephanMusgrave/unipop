How to use unipop
===

Get started with unipop [here].

Key Features
===
There are several core features that make up the backbone of unipop. These features are unipop's cannot-do-without's.

Homepage
---
The homepage is where all the images of stuff to sell are displayed. The design is clean and all images are contained within a beautiful, infinitely scrolling grid.

From here, the user can easily click on things to navigate to the rest of the application.

Item display page
---
<!-- getagging here. Stef, Steve? -->
When a user clicks on an item to see more information, they will be taken to the item's display page. 
They will see:
* who is selling the item
* its price
* the distance from the user to the item 
* auto-changing extra images
* an option to view its location on Google Maps
* I want it button

I want it button
---
The I want it button changes its function according to different conditions. It can change to several different buttons:

**I want it**

Let's say you wanted to buy a toaster. You browse on the homepage and find a nice shiny image of a toaster and decide you want it, so you click the I want it button.

If you are the first buyer, you will be taken to a brand new chatroom, and you start talking to the seller about his/her toaster.

If you are NOT the first buyer, you will be placed on the waitlist for this particularly popular toaster

**I changed my mind**

Let's say you changed your mind about the toaster you just wanted. There will always be a I changed my mind button present that rescinds your want. Don't worry if you accidentaly clicked it; unipop will flash an alert for double-confirmation.

Chatroom
---
Connecting buyers and sellers is what unipop is all about. So the need of a chatroom comes naturally.

Queue management
---
<!-- hi guys what I mean by this is the end negotion buttons, next buyer etc. -->

Unipop can be run in your localhost if you wish to play around with the code. You can do so easily by following these steps.

First you'll need to clone this repo by typing this snippet into your terminal:
```

```

Then change into the newly cloned directory:
```
$ cd projectx
```

Acquire the necessary gems to run unipop:
```
$ bundle install

Update your database by running the migration:
```
$ bin/rake db:migrate
```

Run the application on your localhost (defaults to port 3000):

Finally, open up your web broswer, and in the URL field type:
