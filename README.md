Unipop for Coders
===
Unipop can be run in your localhost if you wish to play around with the code. You can do so easily by following these steps.

First you'll need to clone this repo by typing this snippet into your terminal:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:StephanMusgrave/ProjectX.git
```

Then change into the newly cloned directory:
```
$ cd projectx
```

Acquire the necessary gems to run unipop:
```
$ bundle install
```

Update your database by running the migration:
```
$ bin/rake db:migrate
```

Run the application on your localhost (defaults to port 3000):
```
$ bin/rails server
```

Finally, open up your web broswer, and in the URL field type:
``
localhost:3000
``

Now your browser should look something like this:
